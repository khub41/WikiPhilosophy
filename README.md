# WikiPhilosophy
 How far are we from Philosophy? Which path leads to it? Can we show a supermap of Wikipedia leading to Philosophy? That's my crazy idea for this project

My idea comes from a friend who noticed that from any Wiki article, when clicking on the first link in the body text and repeat this action multiple times, you get to the Philosophy article.

I would like to verify this and study the phenomenon. If possible, I'd like to represent the phenomenon in a cool way! Stay tuned.
